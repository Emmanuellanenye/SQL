This project analyzes Cafe Harmony’s sales and operational performance using an interactive Excel dashboard. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making around sales trends, product performance, and overall business efficiency.

Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and structured the dataset, built pivot tables, and designed a dynamic dashboard that provides a consolidated view of key business metrics. The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly monitor performance, identify trends, and uncover opportunities for revenue growth and operational improvement.
